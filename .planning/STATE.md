## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: SSE over Socket.IO — Hostinger blocks WebSocket upgrades; SSE over HTTP 443 is the correct transport (CRITICAL: validate in Phase 1 before any real-time feature work)
- [Pre-phase]: serialport v13 over Johnny-Five — Johnny-Five abandoned since 2020, incompatible with current serialport APIs
- [Pre-phase]: Drizzle ORM + @neondatabase/serverless pooler — use pooler URL from day one; direct connection URL for migrations only

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: SSE on Hostinger is unvalidated — deploy and verify before Phase 2. If SSE fails, real-time architecture needs reassessment. Recovery cost is HIGH.
- Phase 1: Neon pooler URL format for Drizzle needs verification against current Neon docs (plans updated October 2025).
